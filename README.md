#Endless Pixel World - Maxwell Mollison

Description: This endless tile generation program generates a grassy world with rivers and lakes running throughout. The grass receeds back on any side that it is connected to water on, which allowed for there to not be cutoffs in the water stream if water tiles are diagonal to each other. Though it wasn't my intial intention, the generated product looks like an infinite mini-golf course, which is interesting.

Artist Statement: The effect I was trying to achieve was to generate a top down 2D adventure game type vibe. I'd say I partially achieved that effect. If I were to add more detail and made it so there were things to interact with and objectives to complete I could see it working. Though as it stands right now, it looks more like an empty mini-golf course. The main difficulty I had was that I didn't realize until very late that I could store information in something like info[[i, j]], but now I can apply it to future projects.
